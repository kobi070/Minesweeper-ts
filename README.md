# Minesweeper Game

This is a Minesweeper game built using React and TypeScript. The game is a single-player game where the player has to clear a minefield without detonating any mines.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a square grid.
- Each cell in the grid can either be a mine or empty.
- The player can click on any cell to reveal what's underneath it.
- If the cell is empty, nothing happens.
- If the cell is a mine, the game is over and the player loses.
- If the cell is adjacent to one or more mines, the cell displays the number of adjacent mines.
- The player wins the game when all the cells that are not mines have been revealed.

## Components

The Minesweeper game has the following components:

### GameBoard

The `GameBoard` component is responsible for rendering the game grid. It receives the game state as props and renders each cell accordingly.

### Cell

### Timer

The `Timer` component is responsible for keeping track of the time elapsed since the game started.

## Game Logic

The game logic is implemented in the `MinesweeperGame` class. It keeps track of the game state, including the positions of the mines and the cells that have been revealed. It also handles the game events, such as cell clicks and game resets.

## Conclusion

This Minesweeper game demonstrates how to build a simple game using React and TypeScript. It uses the standard game rules and components to create a playable game that can be easily customized and extended.
